# Kuwait Financial & Fintech Frameworks üá∞üáº

Welcome to the **Kuwait Financial & Fintech Frameworks** repository. This project aims to create a centralized, open-source, and up-to-date collection of all laws, regulations, circulars, and guidelines governing the financial services and fintech industry in the State of Kuwait.

## üéØ Goal

The financial regulatory landscape can be fragmented and difficult to navigate. This repository solves that problem by providing a single, organized source of truth for entrepreneurs, developers, legal professionals, and researchers.

## ·Äñ·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑ Structure

The repository is organized by the primary regulatory body:

* **`/Central_Bank_of_Kuwait_(CBK)`**: Contains all regulations, circulars, and frameworks issued by the CBK, categorized by topic (e.g., Cybersecurity, Payments, Fintech).
* **`/Capital_Markets_Authority_(CMA)`**: Holds the CMA's executive bylaws, rulebooks, and decisions related to capital markets and investment activities.
* **`/General_Legislation`**: Includes overarching laws that impact the financial sector, such as data protection and e-transaction laws.
* **`/_Archive`**: Contains older, superseded versions of regulations for historical reference.

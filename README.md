# Kuwait Financial & Fintech Frameworks üá∞üáº

Welcome to the **Kuwait Financial & Fintech Frameworks** repository. This project aims to create a centralized, open-source, and up-to-date collection of all laws, regulations, circulars, and guidelines governing the financial services and fintech industry in the State of Kuwait.

## üéØ Goal

The financial regulatory landscape can be fragmented and difficult to navigate. This repository solves that problem by providing a single, organized source of truth for entrepreneurs, developers, legal professionals, and researchers.

## üìÑ Structure

The repository is organized by the primary regulatory and governing bodies:

* **`/Central_Bank_of_Kuwait_(CBK)`**: Regulations for banks, payments, and financial stability.
* **`/CITRA`**: Frameworks from the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority.
* **`/National_Cyber_Security_Center_(NCSC)`**: National frameworks and standards for cybersecurity.
* **`/Ministry_of_Interior_(MOI)`**: Directives related to MOI, cybercrime, and residency.
* **`/PCI_Documents`**: Directives related to Payment Card Industry.
* **`/SWIFT_CSP`**: Directives related to SWIFT Payment.
* **`/General_Legislation`**: Overarching laws that impact the entire digital and financial sector.
* **`/_Archive`**: Older, superseded versions of regulations for historical reference.
